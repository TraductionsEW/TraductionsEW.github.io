    <h4>About Emily</h4>
    <p>
      I am a native English speaker who grew up between Victoria, BC and London, England and I graduated with distinction from Concordia University in Montreal with a BA specialization in French to English translation. During my time at Concordia, I completed three semester-long work terms as a translation intern in the private and public sectors. I then began my career in the private sector before turning freelance.

      Throughout my adult life, I have lived in BC, Quebec, England, France, Japan, and Mexico, where I’ve developed highly effective communication skills from working with a broad range of individuals with different ways of expressing their ways of seeing the world. My home base is now Quebec, where my familiarity with the culture and language, in addition to my education, has led me to focus my skills on French to English translation. When not translating, I’m still writing in English; in addition to writing plotlines and comedic character dialogue for a Montreal-based video game company, I have published short fiction and was selected for the Quebec Writers Federation Mentorship Program for a novel in progress. I also regularly tell stories on stage, including at Confabulation in cities across Canada and other storytelling shows. Writing is something I love, and I pride myself in applying my passion for language to my work.
