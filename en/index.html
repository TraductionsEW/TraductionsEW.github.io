    <h4>Keeping the human element in your texts</h4>
    <p>
      If you spend time and effort crafting copy that sets you apart, it’s important that your translator spend equal time and effort rendering the text for a new audience. For this reason, it’s important to choose someone with strong skills as a writer in their native language, and extensive cultural knowledge of the language communities they work with. With nearly ten years’ experience translating texts in various registers for clients in a range of domains from marketing to literature, and a background that includes working as a writer, I have a proven ability to clearly express my clients’ ideas in the right register and tone. My translations are also double checked by a second experienced translator for quality assurance.
